# Fast <sub>a game created in C++ <sub>using [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL)</sub></sub>
### What is this game about?
This game is about a car that is driving on a road and you have to avoid the obstacles that are coming towards you. The game is endless and the speed of the car is increasing as you play. The game is over when you run out of lives. You can collect coins to increase your score and you can also collect hearts to increase your lives.
### How to play?
You can play the game by downloading the executable file from the releases tab or you can compile the source code yourself. The controls are simple, you can use the WASD keys to move the car left and right and you can press the escape key to pause the game.
### How to compile the source code?
You can compile the source code using CMake. You can download CMake from [here](https://cmake.org/download/).
### What are the requirements?
You need to have SDL2 installed on your computer. You can download SDL2 from [here](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php).
### How to run the game?
You can run the game by double clicking on the executable file or by running the command `./Fast` in the terminal.
### What is the purpose of this project?
This project was created for educational purposes. I wanted to learn how to use SDL2 and I also wanted to learn how to create a game in C++. I also wanted to learn how to use CMake.
### Be aware!
This game is not finished yet. I will add more features in the future. I will also fix the bugs that I find. When it will be finished I will modify this section and I will add a link to the latest release.
